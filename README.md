**RevisionProgress.py**
We are expected to prepare thoroughly for our end-of-year Computer Science exam. To track our revision progress, we can create a simple computer program that calculates the percentage of revision completed. This program will store a list of all the topics we need to revise, ask if we have completed each one with a Yes/No question, and then use our answers to calculate the percentage of topics completed. This helps us get a clear view of our progress and manage our study time effectively.

**Return_on_Investiment.py**
The program is expected to take input from the user regarding the total amount spent/invested on the business (total costs) and the total amount raised by the business (total sales). Then, it should compute and present the profit or loss incurred by the business based on the difference between total sales and total costs. Subsequently, it should calculate and display the Return On Investment (ROI), which measures the efficiency of the investment by expressing the profit or loss as a percentage of the total investment. Ultimately, the program provides a clear evaluation of the business's financial performance, indicating whether it has generated profit, incurred losses, and how effectively it has utilized its resources.
